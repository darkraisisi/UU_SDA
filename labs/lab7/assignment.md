c. No, it is assumed snowdepth is zero at the start as there is no information on the starting value.

# 1.2.2
a. Snowmelt. The snowdepth is decreasing in spring causing high streamflow. In addition, peaks in streamflow occur due to direct rain.

# 1.3.1
c. The streamflow is often too low in spring and too high in summer.

d? ik had het fout.
`A higher meltrate causes more rapid melt of snow in spring resulting in more streamflow in that season. With lower meltrates, the snow melts later in the year and in addition more snow is lost due to sublimation of snow in summer.` Dit was het antwoord.

# 2.1.2
a. Higher, streamflow was too high in summer and this will reduce.
