# Note:
Colours of certain elements might differ from image to image as the order of tasks was reversed due to th errors in the assignment on tuesday, task 2 was done prior to task 1. Also the colour in the images of task 2 are different from each other as the python code made my machine crash multiple times, reloading the layers randomized the colours.

# Task 1 - Case study:

1) A screenshot of the used datasets (Amsterdam area), and please indicate which ambulance station in the city of Amsterdam is selected (ID, coordinate, address, etc)
